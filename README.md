🧠 About This Repository

This repository contains my personal C++ practice files, inspired by The C++20 Masterclass by Daniel Gakwaya.

I’m following along with the course to strengthen my C++ fundamentals and modern programming habits.

Although this is a learning journey, it’s not my first encounter with programming — I first learned C++ back in university, and later gained hands-on experience coding with Arduino, Python, and KUKA Robot Language (KRL).
These experiences helped me understand both low-level control and high-level logic, which is why I’m now diving deeper into modern C++, focusing on clean, efficient, and expressive code.
